When creating orders via the API, you must populate specific shipping fields to correctly route shipments through MasonHub. This section covers the required fields and standard mappings.

## Required Fields

When creating orders, you must specify both the shipping provider and service level:

  >
    The shipper to use for this package (e.g., "masonhub", "willCall")
  </Card>
  <Card

  >
    The type of service level required (e.g., "ground", "2day", "overnight")
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Example Order Creation

Here's how to properly set shipping information when creating an order:

```json
{
  "order": {
    "external_id": "ORDER-12345",
    "shipping_address": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Springfield",
      "state": "IL",
      "zip": "62701",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "shipping_service_provider": "masonhub",
    "shipping_service_level": "2day",
    "line_items": [
      {
        "sku": "PRODUCT-001",
        "quantity": 2,
        "price": 25.00
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Mapping Errors

<Warning>
If the mapping is incorrect or hasn't been set up on the MasonHub side, you'll receive an API error message.
</Warning>

**Example Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_SHIP_METHOD",
    "message": "Ship method mapping not found",
    "details": {
      "shipping_service_provider": "invalid_provider",
      "shipping_service_level": "ground"
    }
  }
}
```

## Custom Ship Method Setup

### During Onboarding

Work with your MasonHub onboarding resource to:

- **Map ERP Ship Methods**: Connect your internal shipping codes to MasonHub values
- **Configure Service Levels**: Set up service level agreements and delivery expectations
- **Test Mappings**: Validate mappings work correctly in sandbox environment

### Adding New Ship Methods

<Accordion title="Process for New Ship Methods">
  1. **Business Requirements**: Define the new shipping service needs
  2. **Technical Mapping**: Determine the appropriate provider and service level codes
  3. **Configuration**: Work with MasonHub to add the mapping
  4. **Testing**: Validate the new mapping in sandbox
  5. **Production Deployment**: Roll out to production environment
</Accordion>

## Regional Considerations

### Domestic vs. International

Different ship methods may be required based on destination:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Domestic (US)">
    - Standard ground services
    - Express delivery options
    - Regional carrier preferences
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="International">
    - International express services
    - Customs handling requirements
    - Regional carrier partnerships
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
**Important Security Note**: Your API bearer token provides access to your MasonHub account. Never share it publicly or store it in version control systems.
</Warning>

### Recommended Storage Methods

- **Environment Variables**: Store in secure environment variables
- **Secret Management**: Use tools like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or similar
- **Configuration Files**: Store in encrypted configuration files (not in source code)

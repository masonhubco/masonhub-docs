description: 'Required fields and data for international shipping compliance'
---

<Info>
**Applicability**: This section is only required if you plan to ship internationally with MasonHub.
</Info>

For international orders, MasonHub relies on your API payload to create compliant commercial invoices that meet customs requirements. Proper commercial invoice data is essential for smooth international shipping and customs clearance.

## Overview

Commercial invoices are legal documents required for international shipments that provide customs authorities with details about the goods being shipped, their value, and origin.

<Warning>
**Compliance Critical**: Incorrect or missing commercial invoice data can result in shipment delays, additional fees, or customs holds.
</Warning>

## Required Order-Level Fields

When creating international orders, include these mandatory fields in your API payload:

### Currency and Pricing Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `currency_code` | String | Currency of the transaction (ISO 4217) | `"USD"`, `"EUR"`, `"CAD"` |
| `total_line_items_price` | Decimal | Total price before any discounts | `150.00` |
| `total_discounts` | Decimal | Total line-level discounts applied | `15.00` |
| `total_price` | Decimal | Net total (line items - discounts) | `135.00` |

### Calculation Formula

```
total_price = total_line_items_price - total_discounts
```

<Note>
MasonHub automatically allocates discounts across multiple shipments proportionally when orders split into multiple packages.
</Note>

## Required Line Item Fields

Each line item in international orders must include:

### Pricing Information

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `price` | Decimal | Unit price per item (not extended total) | `40.00` for 2×$40 items |

<Warning>
**Important**: The `price` field should be the unit price, not the extended total. For example, if you're shipping 2 items at $40 each, the price should be `40.00`, not `80.00`.
</Warning>

## Common Issues & Solutions

<Accordion title="Missing Currency Code">
  **Issue**: Order rejected due to missing currency_code

  {
    "currency_code": "USD",
    "total_price": 150.00
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Incorrect Unit Pricing">
  **Issue**: Commercial invoice shows wrong values
  
  **Solution**: Use unit price, not extended price
  ```json
  {
    "quantity": 3,
    "price": 25.00  // Unit price, not 75.00
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Discount Allocation">
  **Issue**: Discounts not properly allocated across shipments
  
  **Solution**: Provide total_discounts at order level, not line level
  ```json
  {
    "total_line_items_price": 200.00,
    "total_discounts": 20.00,
    "total_price": 180.00

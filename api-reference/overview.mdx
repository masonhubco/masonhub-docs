# Introduction

> Comprehensive Order Management System API for inventory, orders, and fulfillment

The MasonHub REST API enables you to programmatically manage your entire supply chain operations, from catalog management to order fulfillment and everything in between.

## Endpoints

* [Order Management](/api-reference/orders): Order creation, updates, cancellation, and lifecycle management  
* [Inventory Management](/api-reference/inventory): Real-time inventory tracking, allocation, and availability

### Fulfillment Operations
* [Inbound Shipments](/api-reference/inbound-shipments): ASN management and receiving operations
* [Shipments](/api-reference/shipments): Outbound shipment tracking and carrier information

### Integration Tools
* [Callbacks & Events](/api-reference/callbacks): Real-time webhooks for order and shipment events
* [DataFactory](/api-reference/datafactory): Testing utilities for simulating operations and generating test data

## Authentication

You can generate an API key through your MasonHub dashboard. API keys are associated with your account and provide access to all MasonHub API endpoints.

### Bearer Token Authentication

The MasonHub API uses JWT Bearer tokens for authentication. Include your token in the Authorization header of all requests.

Bearer tokens begin with the `eyJ` prefix and are used for all API operations. Keep your bearer tokens secret.

<Note>
All API endpoints require HTTPS with a valid JWT Bearer token. Requests over HTTP or without authentication will be rejected.
</Note>

### Using Your Token

Include the bearer token in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.masonhub.co/{account}/api/v1/orders" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

## API Design Principles

The MasonHub API follows consistent design principles:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Search-First Design"
    icon="magnifying-glass"
  >
    GET methods use search parameters for composability and flexible data retrieval
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Batch Operations"
    icon="layer-group"
  >
    All methods accept/return arrays for efficient bulk operations
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Flexible Responses"
    icon="toggle-on"

    Use `list_type=detail|summary` for appropriate response detail levels
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="RESTful Design"
    icon="code"
  >
    Standard GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations (No PATCH)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Data Formats

### Date and Time
All timestamps use **RFC3339** format for consistency:
```
2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
```

### Pagination
Standard pagination parameters across all list endpoints:

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `limit` | integer | Number of results [1..100] | 30 |
| `offset` | integer | Pagination offset | 0 |

### Response Format
All responses follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "limit": 30,
  "offset": 0,
  "list_type": "detail",
  "data": [
    // Array of results
  ]
}
```
